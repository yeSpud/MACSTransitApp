# Contributing

## Getting Started

Want to contribute to the apps development? 
To start see the following prerequisites to make sure your machine is ready for android development, and then follow the installation section to get a copy of this project for your development

### Prerequisites

For starters you will need a working version of [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed in order to clone the project, as well as track and push changes. 

The final bit of software required is [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). This will be used to edit the project, and test the build on either a physical device, or an emulator.

### Installing

Simply clone this repository using git, and then open the cloned project in android studio. That's all there is to it.

### Submitting updates
Submit a pull request to the [Open Testing branch](https://github.com/yeSpud/MACSTransitApp/tree/Open-Testing), and make sure that your updates are well documented, well commented, elegantly written, and above all else, stable.
Also be sure to edit the [whats new file](whatsnew/) to list all the noticeable changes.

The pull request will then undergo a review process, and either be accepted and merged, or rejected with comments and critiques for how to do better.
Once the changes have been running on the Open Testing version of the app it will then be merged with the Production version of the app.
